## General Information
-Lending Club Case Study helps to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of loss while lending to customers.
-When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    ->If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

    ->If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
-This project helps to identify such risk factors thereby helping the company to avoid such credit losses.
-The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking respective actions.


## Conclusions
- People with an income of Rs.50000 on an average are taking loans of Rs.25000 or more which can be a potential threat to the company and can also cause credit loss.
- Higher the loan amount borrowed,higher is the rate of interest. This benefits the company as it can minimize the chances of credit losses.
- The state having highest number of defaulters was also obtained. This information will benefit the company to a larger extent and also demands for more survey to be conducted in such states before dispersal of any loan amount.
- Higher loan amount for longer term have lower grades.
